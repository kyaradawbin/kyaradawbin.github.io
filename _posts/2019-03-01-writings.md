I really enjoy writing and often write opinion essays about topics that interest me. Here are a couple of things that I have written prior to creating my blog.

["Nights Without Stars"](/resources/documents/nights-without-stars.pdf) is a personal essay about mental illness and the journey one takes while in recovery. It was inspired by my own experiences.

["The Inherent Polarization of the Internet"](/resources/documents/inherent-polarization-of-the-internet.pdf) is a thinkpiece that I researched and wrote about in January 2017. It is my response to the growing conversation about politics on social media. It analyzes human behavior and psychology and relates that to how social media caters to basic instincts.
