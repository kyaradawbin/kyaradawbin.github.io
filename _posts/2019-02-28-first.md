Well, this is it: hopefully the first of many posts on my website. I've been caught up in studying and work, but now I've decided to take a minute for myself and recharge with a personal project.

I taught myself the basics of Git last year when I hand-wrote the HTML for this website. I didn't do everything completely on my own, however. Looking at other repositories on Github and inspecting element on various websites was the greatest teacher for me.

This year, I decided to make the jump into using both Jekyll and Github Pages. It seems really intuitive so far, so hopefully this takes away any excuses for continuing this blog.

I plan on sharing the projects that I've been working on, as well as keep a kind of portfolio of things that I'm proud of.

If you would like, you're welcome to use my future posts as a guide.

All the best,

Kyara
