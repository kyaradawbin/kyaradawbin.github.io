<h2 id="faq">Ask me anything!</h2>
  <blockquote><p>What's with the weird characters in the title?</p></blockquote>
  <p>It's IPA! No, not the beverage. It's my name written phonetically using the International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>
  <blockquote><p>What are your current goals?</p></blockquote>
  <p>Short term: learn a few songs on the ukelele. Long term: run 10k. Slightly longer term: contribute to open-source health projects.</p>
   <blockquote><p>What are your hobbies right now?</p></blockquote>
  <p>I enjoy calligraphy, gardening, hiking, lockpicking, sketching, and spending too much time on Reddit. You can see updates on <a href="/blog">my blog</a> to see what I'm currently working on...</p>
