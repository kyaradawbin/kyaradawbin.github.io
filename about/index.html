  <h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions.</h1>
   <blockquote><p>How many languages do you speak?</p></blockquote>
  <p>I speak English fluently and Spanish at an intermediate level (B1). However, I can read a newspaper article in Romance languages and I have a very basic understanding of Dutch, Swedish, and German. Because the definition of "fluency" is so vague, I refer to myself as an "ex-monoglot"--or a person who no longer speaks just one language.</p>
   <blockquote><p>What languages are you learning?</p></blockquote>
  <p>Because I encounter a lot of different languages on a regular basis, I pick up words here and there. I am serious about learning Spanish, French, and German. In the future, I would like to be conversationally fluent in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_the_United_Nations" title="Official languages of the United Nations - Wikipedia">official languages of the United Nations.</a></p>
   <blockquote><p>What is your dream career?</p></blockquote>
  <p>I would love to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics" title="Computational linguistics - Wikipedia">computational linguist</a>, which pretty much means that I combine two of my interests into a really futuristic-sounding job title.</p>
   <blockquote><p>What are your hobbies?</p></blockquote>
  <p>Art is fascinating to me and I find myself doodling a lot in my spare time. I also like to garden, go on hikes, and make up fantasy worlds (with constructed lands, languages, and histories). Overall, I have a lot of different interests and I tend to bounce between them.</p>
