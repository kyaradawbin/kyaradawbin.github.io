<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<blockquote><p>The world is a very puzzling place. If you're not willing to be puzzled, you just become a replica of someone else's mind.</p><p>Noam Chomsky</p></blockquote>
<p id="about-summary">Hi, my name's Kyara. I like technology, art, and being puzzled. Welcome to my corner of the Internet!</p>
<p id="accomplishments">I enjoy keeping myself busy, which is a good thing because I work in healthcare and information technology while balancing my studies. When I'm not working, I volunteer through Rotary International and visit new places in Maine. I'm looking forward to continuing my education at the University of Maine's Computer Science program.</p>
